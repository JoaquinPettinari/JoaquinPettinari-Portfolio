    I started studying self-taught to dedicate myself to web development. I started with the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript until I had my first course with React technology.
    Today I keep my learning process active and I would like to find a job with relocation possibilities." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
